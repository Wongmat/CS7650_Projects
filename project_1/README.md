# CS7650 - Project 1

This repository consists of starter code from the [Project 1 colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QEPgC2FvXCvtZy2o4YBIkRPPLoG4gHJx). We setup the repo to only facilitate development outside the given colab notebook. Please note that you should submit the notebook and the output files to Gradescope and not this repository. The submission instructions are in the colab notebook.

In this assignment, you will implement the perceptron algorithm, and a simple, but competitive neural bag-of-words model, as described in [this](https://aclanthology.org/P15-1162.pdf) paper for text classification. You will train your models on a (provided) dataset of positive and negative movie reviews and report accuracy on a test set.
